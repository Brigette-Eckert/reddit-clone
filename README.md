#User Stories
```
  1. As a user, I want to see several discussion categories (sub-reddits) on the main page.
  2. As a user, I want to click a category to visit its collection of posts.
  3. As a user, I want to click a post to view its contents (For now simply hide/show contents. Routing to a page for a specific post requires concepts from tonight's homework).
  4. As a user, I want to click on a post to expand/collapse it, so I can view whatever funny picture, link, or news article other users have posted.
  5. As a user, I want to add new posts to a discussion category.
  6. As a user, I want to update my post as necessary.
  7. As a user, I want the option to delete my post.
